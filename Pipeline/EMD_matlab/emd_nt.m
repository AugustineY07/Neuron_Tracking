function [x, fval, L2] = emd_nt(F1, F2, W1, W2, mw1, mw2, chan_pos, dim_mask, l2_weight, xStep, zStep, Func)
% NT = "Neuron tracking" specialized version of EMD (info below)
% Addition parameters are:
% mw1, mw2: (nUnit x nSite) arrays, mean waveforms for the units included in F1 and F2
% chan_pos: (nSite x 2) array of x and z coordinates of sites on the probe.
% Note that F1 and F2 must be recorded on identical sites of the probe.
% 
% EMD   Earth Mover's Distance between two signatures
%    [X, FVAL] = EMD(F1, F2, W1, W2, FUNC) is the Earth Mover's Distance
%    between two signatures S1 = {F1, W1} and S2 = {F2, W2}. F1 and F2
%    consists of feature vectors which describe S1 and S2, respectively.
%    Weights of these features are stored in W1 and W2. FUNC is a function
%    which computes the ground distance between two feature vectors.
%
%    Example:
%    -------
%        f1 = [[100, 40, 22]; [211, 20, 2]; [32, 190, 150]; [2, 100, 100]];
%        f2 = [[0, 0, 0]; [50, 100, 80]; [255, 255, 255]];
%        w1 = [0.4; 0.3; 0.2; 0.1];
%        w2 = [0.5; 0.3; 0.2];
%        ...
%        [x fval] = emd(f1, f2, w1, w2, @gdf);
%        ...
%
%    EMD is formalized as linear programming problem in which the flow that
%    minimizes an overall cost function subject to a set of constraints is
%    computed. This implementation is based on "The Earth Mover's Distance
%    as a Metric for Image Retrieval", Y. Rubner, C. Tomasi and L. Guibas,
%    International Journal of Computer Vision, 40(2), pp. 99-121, 2000.
%
%    The outcome of EMD is the flow (X) which minimizes the cost function
%    and the value (FVAL) of this flow.
