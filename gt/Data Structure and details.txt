Each drive contains data from 1 mouse. Let me try to explain the data structure.

AL032 and AL036 are 4-shank mice, AL031 is a 1-shank mouse.

Each folder should have 7 folders: 6 with numbers as names (such as 1,2,3,4,5,6) and 1 folder called ephys.
- The first folder with a number contains "timeline". 
This is what we use to make sure we can synchronize all the data we record in the rig. 
For your purposes, relevant timeline channels are called "photoDiode" and "flipper". 
The photodiode flips back and forth when there's any change on the screen (so in this case when images appear [probably disappear as well]). 
The flipper flips back and forth randomly. [introduce]

- The other folders with numbers contain what we call "Block". There are 5 blocks total, representing 5 trials. [of 120 images shuffled]
This is data sent from an experiment computer, for example it records the times when stimulus should be presented on the screen and the identity of the stimulus. 
block.events.numValues = stimulus_id presented in that trials
block.events. = stimulus_times presented 

- In "ephys" folder there is an .ap.bin file - that's the recording. 
The last channel in this file is the flipper channel that records that random signal sent from the timeline. 

Using flipper and photodiode it's possible to align all the events from multiple sources to each other. 
I am attaching an example script that can be used (possibly with some modifications) to do this. 

After you get the alignments once, you can use them to extract timings of anything you are interested in the block (stimulus onset, stimulus offset, presentation of one particular stimulus etc etc) 
and find out what neural responses to that event are.
